# GAPT
Global Acoustics Path Tracing

This library consists of 2 files, PTAudio.cpp and PTAudio.hpp within the base source folder. It is built into the Vulkan Examples by Sascha Willems: https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan

Project files must be built with cmake, and vulkan must be updated with a modern GPU in order to compile.
